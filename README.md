# S2: Rulers Gambit

## What you need to download to run the code

**flask_cors and sqlite3**
We used Anaconda Navigator but I’m pretty sure the school computers have these already, so you probably do too

## How to run the code 
Before opening the html file:
    - Go into the file **[app.py](app,py)** and left click or just left click the file name on Explorer
    - Go to the bottom of the pop-up menu and click Run Python File in Terminal

Links to the 2 pages mentioned in the brief
* **[main/scenario page](senario_page.html)**: A “Main screen” where users play the game.

## The Additional Requirements
Links to the pages that connect to the database

**The Stats Page**

* **[stats page](stat_page.html)**: where the users enter stats
