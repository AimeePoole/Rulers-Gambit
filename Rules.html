            <h2>Welcome to WAR!</h2>
            <p>You’re the new ruler of Pydrain. You’re right in the middle of two factions that are waging war to end all wars. Will you and your allies make it out alive?</p>
            <p>Get to the end of the game without any stats reaching zero. You have 6 stats: Economy, Military, Security, Welfare, Agriculture. If any of these hits zero you lose. 
                Get to the end with the most points possible and you’ll be at the top of the leaderboard.</p>
            <p>Pick what points out of your 20 to put into each stat. You will need to put at least 1 in every stat to survive.</p>
            <p>These are 3 phases with 5 randomised scenarios, these scenarios will affect your Stats. Allocate your points wisely as each will affect your stats in different ways.
                 Some solutions require certain stats to choose, so invest your points wisely.</p>
